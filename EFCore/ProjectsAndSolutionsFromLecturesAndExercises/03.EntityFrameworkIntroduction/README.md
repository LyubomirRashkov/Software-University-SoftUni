## PROBLEMS DESCRIPTION - INTRODUCTION TO ENTITY FRAMEWORK


### Problem 1.	Employees Full Information

NOTE: You will need method public static string GetEmployeesFullInformation(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 

Now we can use the SoftUniContext to extract data from our database. Your first task is to extract all employees and return their first, last and middle name, their job title and salary, rounded to 2 symbols after the decimal separator, all of those separated with a space. Order them by employee id.

Example

| Output |

Your task is to extract all employees with salary over 50000. Return their first names and salaries in format “{firstName} - {salary}”.Salary must be rounded to 2 symbols, after the decimal separator. Sort them alphabetically by first name.

Example

| Output |
| --------- |
| Brian - 72100.00 |
| Dylan - 50500.00 |

Use Express Profiler and check if the query Entity Framework Core sent is correct (there is only one query, but there may be more that are performed by EF for checks).

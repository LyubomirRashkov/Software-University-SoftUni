## PROBLEMS DESCRIPTION - FUNCTIONS AND STORED PROCEDURES


### Problem 1.	Create Table Logs

Create a table – Logs (LogId, AccountId, OldSum, NewSum). Add a trigger to the Accounts table that enters a new entry into the Logs table every time the sum on an account changes. Submit only the query that creates the trigger.

Example

| LogId | AccountId | OldSum | NewSum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 123.12 | 113.12 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Problem 2.	Create Table Emails

Create another table – NotificationEmails(Id, Recipient, Subject, Body). Add a trigger to logs table and create new email whenever new record is inserted in logs table. The following data is required to be filled for each email:

  +	Recipient – AccountId
  +	Subject – "Balance change for account: {AccountId}"
  +	Body - "On {date} your balance was changed from {old} to {new}."

Submit your query only for the trigger action.

Example

| Id | Recipient | Subject | Body |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | Balance change for account: 1 | On Sep 12 2016 2:09PM your balance was changed from 113.12 to 103.12. |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Problem 3.	Deposit Money

Add stored procedure usp_DepositMoney (AccountId, MoneyAmount) that deposits money to an existing account. Make sure to guarantee that MoneyAmount is not negative and it is with precision up to fourth sign after decimal point. The procedure should produce exact results working with the specified precision.

Example - Here is the result for AccountId = 1 and MoneyAmount = 10:

| AccountId | AccountHolderId | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 133.1200 |

### Problem 4.	Withdraw Money

Add stored procedure usp_WithdrawMoney (AccountId, MoneyAmount) that withdraws money from an existing account. Make sure to guarantee that MoneyAmount is not negative and it is with precision up to fourth sign after decimal point. The procedure should produce exact results working with the specified precision.

Example - Here is the result for AccountId = 5 and MoneyAmount = 25:

| AccountId | AccountHolderId | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 11 | 36496.2000 |

### Problem 5.	Money Transfer

Write stored procedure usp_TransferMoney(SenderId, ReceiverId, Amount) that transfers money from one account to another. Make sure to guarantee valid positive MoneyAmount with precision up to fourth sign after decimal point. Make sure that the whole procedure passes without errors and if error occurs make no change in the database. You can use both: "usp_DepositMoney", "usp_WithdrawMoney" (look at previous two problems about those procedures). 

Example - Here is the result for SenderId = 5, ReceiverId = 1 and MoneyAmount = 5000:

| AccountId | AccountHolderId | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 5123.12 |
| 5 | 11 | 31521.2000 |

### Queries for Diablo Database

You are given a database "Diablo" holding users, games, items, characters and statistics available as SQL script. Your task is to write some stored procedures, views and other server-side database objects and write some SQL queries for displaying data from the database.

Important: start with a clean copy of the "Diablo" database on each problem. Just execute the SQL script again.

### Problem 6.	Trigger

1. Users should not be allowed to buy items with higher level than their level. Create a trigger that restricts that. The trigger should prevent inserting items that are above specified level while allowing all others to be inserted.

2. Add bonus cash of 50000 to users: baleremuda, loosenoise, inguinalself, buildingdeltoid, monoxidecos in the game "Bali".

3. There are two groups of items that you must buy for the above users. The first are items with id between 251 and 299 including. Second group are items with id between 501 and 539 including.
Take off cash from each user for the bought items.

4. Select all users in the current game ("Bali") with their items. Display username, game name, cash and item name. Sort the result by username alphabetically, then by item name alphabetically. 

Output

| Username | Name | Cash | Item Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Problem 7.	Massive Shopping

1. User Stamat in Safflower game wants to buy some items. He likes all items from Level 11 to 12 as well as all items from Level 19 to 21. As it is a bulk operation you have to use transactions. 

2. A transaction is the operation of taking out the cash from the user in the current game as well as adding up the items. 

3. Write transactions for each level range. If anything goes wrong turn back the changes inside of the transaction.

4. Extract all of Stamat’s item names in the given game sorted by name alphabetically.

Output


| Item Name |

### Problem 9.	Delete Employees
